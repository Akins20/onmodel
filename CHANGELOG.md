# Changelog

## Unreleased

- First working loop, for one subject at a time: the brief, the settled decisions,
  the context files and the reference images go to a Gemini image model ahead of
  the subject; each candidate comes back, is keyed to transparency, trimmed,
  measured, cut to the sizes asked for and written with a sidecar that holds its
  prompt and turns; a text model judges the candidates against the brief with the
  measured facts stated as true, picks one and names the edit that would improve it.
- Keying without an alpha channel: the subject is asked for on a flat key colour,
  chosen furthest from the palette so a magenta brand is never keyed on magenta;
  edge pixels are un-mixed from the key rather than cut; a one-pixel key-tinted rim
  that a JPEG's anti-aliasing leaves past the soft band is softened only where it
  touches transparency. Measured per candidate: background removed, soft edge, key
  colour left in the subject, the rim against the interior, bounds, edge contact.
- Pixel-art mode: the model draws large on a grid, the output is shrunk to the grid
  with an area filter, snapped to the palette, and made fully opaque or clear; the
  judge sees the sprite that ships, not the painting; a hard-pixel preview is written
  for people; how much of the painting was really on a grid is measured.
- A baseline JPEG decoder in plain JavaScript, since the image models answer in
  JPEG and offer no PNG; it matches Chromium's decode of the same bytes to within
  three levels.
- Prices built in as of 2026-10-07 with image tokens at the image rate and thinking
  at the text rate, which is how the API bills; a dry-run estimate before a batch; a
  per-run budget that refuses a batch that cannot fit and stops a run whose real
  thinking ran past the estimate; an append-only ledger and `onmodel cost`.
- A contact sheet beside the images: as painted, keyed over a checkerboard, the sized
  outputs, the facts, the judge's scores and notes, the pick; light first with a dark
  toggle.
